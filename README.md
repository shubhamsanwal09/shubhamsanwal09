## About Me

I'm a passionate footballer turned data analyst on a mission to merge my love for football with the power of data, technology, and automation. Having represented Delhi Dynamos FC and Odisha FC at the national level and played A Division in Delhi, I’ve experienced the game on the field — now I’m focused on making an impact off the field as well.
